# Robotics-Laboratory-6
### Brief
In this laboratory with Sl. Dr. Ing. Adrian Cartal, I had to use programming languages to solve the inverse position problem at the parallel plane robot structure. The inverse geometric problem. The x and y coordinates of the point M are given and the angles φ1 and φ2 (the angles of exit from the gearmotors) are required. A, L1 and L2, are previously adopted geometric parameters. Given the x and y coordinates of the point, the angles were determined in several positions, the trajectory being discretized in 10 segments.
